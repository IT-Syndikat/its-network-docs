# sozial.asozial install guide

Sozial.asozial is a FW8888 (Intel Atom x86) machine with 6 network interfaces,
eth0 throu eth5 where eth5 is a fiber slot so we're not going to use it for now.

## Port-eth mapping

Just works in OpenWRT! They sort the ethX names by MAC like they should :)

eth0: Port 1
eth1: Port 2
eth2: Port 3
eth3: Port 4
eth4: Port 5

If in doubt:

$ ethtool -p ethX

This will blink the status leds on ethX so you can identify it visually.

## Port Function Assignment

eth0: Broken causes timeouts and adapter resets occationally
eth1: Broken --''--
eth2: --free--
eth3: Uplink SW0, Freifunk
eth3.2: AP Management Plane VLAN (APCTL)
eth4: --free--

To install use `opkg update && opkg install <package-name>`. You need to run
`opkg update` since openwrt stores package lists in RAM so by the time you need
them they're likely not there.
